# EXERCISE
1. Just do 10k steps a day
or (something like)
- Mon - <a href="#LISS">LISS</a>
- Tue - <a href="#SE">S/E</a>
- Wed - LISS
- Thu - Break
- Fri - S/E
- Sat - LISS
- Sun - Break

- Can move break to whatever days work best, can move LISS and SE days around but 1 LISS followed by 1 SE works really well.

<div id="LISS">
    ## LISS
    
    - Low intensity steady state cardio
    - intensity should be low i.e. - you should be able to hold a conversation comfortably but barely or you heart rate after 15 mins should stay steady
    - start by working upto 30 mins if needed.
    - If you start at a base time of 15 mins, add 5 minutes to your base time on the third workout of the day for a total workout of 20 mins. Next week your base time is 20 mins and you will add 5 mins to the third workout and so on...  
    - Want to ideally do an hour/ hour and a half.
    - Start by working up to 30 mins a day
    - The main goal is to start the habit and try to not injure and tire ourselves so we can do this consistently
    - Do stretches after, do plank after (try to work up to 90 second plank)

</div>

<div id="SE">
    ## SE
    
    - This is going to help build ligament strength, joint and muscle endurance
    - Warmup
    - We will do a circuit of
     - Use whatever weight but make sure it's one you can easily do for 30 reps
     1. Squat (3 x 10)/(3 x 10)/(3 x 20)/(3 x 30)
     2. Bench Press (3 x 10)/(3 x 10)/(3 x 20)/(3 x 30)
     3. Kettlebell swings (1 x 25)/(1 x 50)/(1 x 75)/(2 x 50)
     4. Overhead Press (3 x 10)/(3 x 10)/(3 x 20)/(3 x 30)
     5. Rows (3 x 10)/(3 x 10)/(3 x 20)/(3 x 30)
     - 3 x 10 = 3 sets of 10 reps each
     - rest 90 seconds to 5 mins between sets
     - circuit goes like this - 1 set squat,5 min rest, 1 set bench, 5 min rest, 1 set kettlebell swings, 5 min rest, 1 set overhead press, 5 mins rest, 1 set row, 5 mins rest. Start over until youve done 3 steps
     - The next week we will increase to 3 x 20 , the week after we will increase to 3 x 30 denoted above by (3 x 10)/ (3 x 20)/.... etc.
     - Then we will repeat the whole cycle once more 3 x 10/3 x 10/3 x 20/ 3 x 30
     - Or you can do it this way (3 x 10 ) - 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of (3 x 20) then 2 weeks of (3 x 30) etc. - this is actually harder the 2 weeks of 3 x 30 are really hard
     - After this is over you can chose your SE workout
     - Recommend doing 100 kettlebell swings per SE workout after this
</div>

# DO NOT OVERTHINK - FOLLOW THIS PLAN FOR 2 months

# DO NOT LOOK ONLINE at ANY DIET, EXERCISE, FITNESS related content - just do these exercises and call it quits
# Note starting weight, starting resting heart rate and starting Vo2 Max or Cardio Fitness
# Write down how you feel about yourself, your general health, energy levels etc.
