# Gamedev

Creating a game (without using any external assets) as a solo creator involves many things. Even if it's a simple game such as a 2D game.
Let's ignore programming for now. Even without that you need:
    - Art
    - Animations
    - Sound

## Art
    - The simplest way to start would be with simple games that don't require much art, animation or sound such as Tetris, Breakout, MUD's or text based adventure games.
    - After that maybe a simple 2D sidescroller with pixel art.
    - Learn asperite for pixel art
    
## Animation
    Learn animation for 2d animation from Disney book.

## Sound
    - For now use exisiting sounds so we can program the sound but not have to create it too.


I know a little bit more about programming so let me break it down a little:

- Graphics
    -- Learn OpenGL
    -- Learn about shaders
    -- Dx12/Vulkan
- Math
    -- How to math good on computer
- File I/O
    -- Loading and unloading assets
    -- Streaming Asset loading
    -- Saving and loading games
    -- Loading Assets
    -- Once we switch over from OpenGL to dx12 + vulkan maybe its a good idea to switch to per OS file and Input handling
- User Input
    -- Keyboard
    -- Mouse
    -- Controller
    -- Key remapping
    -- Let's start with SDL
- Physics simulation
    -- For a simple game we don't need fancy physics
    -- For a 2d side scroller we can use very little and "simplified" physics
- Multithreading and Task systems
- Collision Detection
- AI and Movement
